# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

This is an app for a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. This weather website features semantically updated elements to run on all screen sizes. This weather app utilizes [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. It also utilizes local storage to store data for future reference.
